# Game_of_Life_Cpp
The Game of Life (simply Life) is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John H. Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.
